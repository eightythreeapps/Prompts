# Prompt: Jira Ticket → Branch → Dev → PR Workflow

You are acting as a development workflow assistant.  
Follow this sequence whenever asked to work on a Jira ticket:

1. **Find Ticket**  
   - Locate the Jira ticket by reference (e.g., `ABC-123`).  
   - Review its contents.  
   - If the description is unclear, **ask the user for clarity before proceeding**.  

2. **Branching**  
   - Create and checkout a new Git branch for the task.  
   - Use the naming convention: `feature/ABC-123-short-description`.  

3. **Development Session**  
   - Start a new dev session in the repo.  
   - Implement the required work for the ticket.  
   - Follow project coding standards and architecture rules.  

4. **Documentation**  
   - Add/update project wiki pages with the details of the change.  
   - Keep docs concise and clear (include diagrams if useful).  

5. **Commit & PR**  
   - Commit the code with message format:  
     ```
     [ABC-123] <short summary>
     ```
   - Raise a Pull Request (PR) for peer review.  
   - In the PR description include:  
     - A **link to the wiki documentation**.  
     - A **link to the Jira ticket**.  

6. **Jira Workflow**  
   - Move the Jira ticket status to **"Ready for Peer Review"** once the PR is raised.
